This directory contains an example of simple program that exploits Figaro models translated in C++ by Fig2Cpp.py: an interactive simulator. 

The file FigaroModelTemplate.h is necessary, but it is not (much) dependent on the application. It is designed to be used in STORM-Figaro, but the only thing to do to use it with InteractiveSimulatorMain.cpp is to set the compilation option INTERACTIVE (see the tests directory).
